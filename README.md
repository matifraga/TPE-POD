# TPE - Map Reduce

### How should I run this?

*It's pretty easy.*

In the project folder:
```
./run.sh
```

For the server:
```
cd server/target/tpe-pod-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
./run-node.sh
```

For the client:
```
cd client/target/tpe-pod-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
./run-client.sh
```

*See? I told you.*
